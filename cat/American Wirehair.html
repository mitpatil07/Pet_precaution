          <h1>American Wirehair personality</h1>
          <p>The American Wirehair is a very pleasant cat to have as a companion. She is easy going and placid. The Wirehair is a loving cat and will attach herself to every member of her family. While the Wirehair loves to play, she actually doesn't need hourly attention. If she is in the mood to play, she'll bring a toy to her parent. The Wirehair also plays well by herself, and she is a good companion for single people.
          <h1>What to expect</h1>
          <p> The American Wirehair is a thick, muscular cat and her nutrition must be carefully controlled. Despite the heavy boning and musculature of the cat, you want to make certain she keeps a proper weight and does not get out of condition. The Wirehair will play when she wants to and will find a toy or create one out of anything she finds. Interactive play may be necessary to keep her in good shape and make certain that she gets adequate exercise. A daily brushing can easily be incorporated into playtime with the Wirehair. Unlike curly-coated cats, the Wirehair's coat has three layers of fur so brushing her is not a problem. You do not have to be careful about breaking hairs on the coat. The Wirehair tolerates being left alone. She is an affectionate cat but also spends time just sleeping in the sun. The Wirehair is an easy cat to care for and makes a wonderful, quiet companion.
          <h1>History of the American Wirehair</h1>
          <p>In 1966, a kitten was found in a litter that had wiry looking fur, similar to that of a Wirehaired Terrier. The cats that produced this kitten may have been American Shorthairs, or they may have been farm cats that strongly resembled Americans. This kitten was sold to a breeder who decided to try to replicate this spontaneous coat mutation. The kittens resulting from these matings were taken by other breeders and a carefully planned breeding program was started, dedicated to producing the American Wirehair breed. The American Wirehair is becoming increasingly popular in the United States. This breed has a show standard, which is almost identical to that of the American Shorthair. However, every individual hair in the coat is crimped and curly. This texture creates a unique, wiry feeling to the coat.
