          <h1>American Curl personality</h1>
          <p> American Curls are friendly, affectionate, and active cats that are often said to have a somewhat "doglike" attachment to their owners. They like to gently poke and prod their humans with their paws and will often follow their favorite family members from room to room around the house. They are exceptionally intelligent cats as well. Some have been known to figure out how to flick light switches on and off, and many learn how to open and close doors and cupboards.
            They typically retain a kitten-like playfulness throughout their entire lives and love toplay with toys, climb and explore furniture and cat trees, investigate anything new broughtinto the home, and even play fetch. However, once playtime is over, your American Curl islikely to cuddle up on your lap, give you some affectionate head bumps, and spend some timein peaceful companionship.
            It's important to note, however, that American Curls don't like to be left alone for toolongâ€”so you might have to consider whether your schedule can accommodate several hours ofattention and playtime each day.
            These friendly felines aren't too large when fully grown, although they are somewhatmuscular for their small-to-medium size. They generally reach maturity by one to two yearsof age. American Curls aren't especially talkative cats, tending towards quiet trillsrather than loud meows. A sociable cat, most American Curls take readily to children andother pets in the home, especially if they offer extra opportunities for play and fun.
        </p>

          <h1>What to expect</h1>
          <p>
            The American Curl enjoys daily exercise. They relish cat trees in the house with perches for climbing and jumping. If they are provided with enough exercise space, they tend to maintain their weight rather well. They also like interactive play. While not considered a lap cat, the Curl likes to be next to people..</p>

          <h1>History of the American Curl</h1>
          <p>Despite their popularity, American Curls don't have a long history as a distinct breed. In fact, the first American Curl litter was born only a few decades ago in Southern California.

            In 1981, founding breeders Joe and Grace Ruga adopted a stray, long-haired black kitten with the Curl's distinctive ears and named her Shulamith. Only a few months later, Shulamith gave birth to a litter of kittens, half of which had the same curled ears. By 1983, cat breeders were working hard to selectively breed cats to preserve and propagate this unique characteristic. Fortunately, genetics were on their side: A feline geneticist named Roy Robinson found that the ear-curling gene was a dominant trait, so cats with only one copy of the gene would be born with curled ears.
            
            The American Curl became incredibly popular over a short period of time, and was quickly recognized by the International Cat Association in 1987 and by the Cat Fanciers' Association in 1993. Today, American Curls are ranked 27th among the United States' most popular cat breeds.</p>
