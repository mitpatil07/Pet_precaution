          <h1>Bombay Cat personality</h1>
          <p>Younger Bombays are active, curious cats and adapt very easily to change. At any age, they love to look at the world around them and their favorite place may often turn out to be a window where they can observe the world outside. These cats are very affectionate and will, at times, demand time with their parents. The Bombay is well known for jumping on a person's lap and spreading her beautiful body across the newspaper the person is reading. However, as they get older, some Bombays can tend to become a bit too placid, preferring to watch rather than get involved in activities.</p>

          <h1>What to expect</h1>
          <p>The Bombay is a very solid cat both in looks and in feel, and has great strength. She is a good climber and jumper and should have cat trees and perches. The Bombay is a sturdy, stocky cat and you might have to watch her nutrition carefully to prevent obesity, particularly if she does not get enough exercise. While adult Bombays are placid, they also tend to be very kittenish and love their daily play time. They love being adored by their parent and having their stomach rubbed and being petted. A daily petting session is a must for any Bombay.</p>
          <h1>History of the Bombay Cat</h1>
          <p>In the late 1950s, American breeders desired a cat that had the structure and appearance of the Burmese but wanted the cat to be a deep, glossy, patent leather black. Hopefully, this breed would remind one of the Indian Black Leopard. To this end, a breeding program began using the Burmese and a black American Shorthair with bright, copper eyes. The resulting cat was named the Bombay to remind people of the Black Leopard, which she actually does resemble. The Bombay was recognized for the show bench in the late 1970s. While still not common, Bombays are crowd pleasers at every show where they are exhibited.
