          <h1>Abyssinian personality</h1>
          <p>While an active cat, the Abyssinian is an easy cat to have in your home. They love people and other animals. They will play with their own toys for hours but also enjoy a good period of time of interactive play with their parents. They will talk to you in a soft, quiet voice. The Abyssinian is loving and affectionate, and loves to spend time with her parent. While the Abyssinian coat is easy to care for, the Abyssinian likes being combed or rubbed with a chamois cloth. She will reward you with a loving purr.</p>

          <h1>What to expect</h1>
          <p>
            Abyssinians are active cats and generally will keep their weight under control with compensating exercise. They should have some high perches and cat trees available to them so they can jump and climb.
            Abyssinians are social cats and like to have some company. This company can be provided by having another cat or pet around when human companions are not at home.</p>

          <h1>History of the Abyssinian</h1>
          <p>While the Abyssinian cat is considered to be the breed that can trace her roots directly to the Nile Valley, she was actually developed in Great Britain. In the 1860s, a cat was brought to Britain by Lord Robert Napier following a military expedition to Abyssinia. This cat was named Zulu and she was the foundation of the beautiful breed known today as the Abyssinian. The unique ticking pattern on the co,at of the Abyssinian reminded people of the camouflage pattern on the coat of the wild rabbit. This characteristic was so delightful that Zulu was bred to random-bred cats that carried a similar look to their coat and the Abyssinian breed was created.
          The breed itself was extremely popular and Abyssinian cats were soon being bred throughoutEurope and in the United States and Canada. This popularity proved to be the salvation of thebreed as the two world wars almost decimated the breed in Europe. New Abyssinians wereimported and the breed continued. In the late 1960s, when the feline leukemia virus almostdestroyed the breed once again in Britain, more Abyssinians were brought into Britain toreestablish the breed again.</p>
