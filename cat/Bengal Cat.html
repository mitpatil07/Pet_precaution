          <h1>Bengal Cat personality</h1>
          <p>While many people consider the Bengal to be a wild cat that only pretends to be domesticated, the breed is actually very sweet and loving. The Bengal attaches closely to her people and is a loyal friend. As a large, athletic cat, the Bengal needs to run, jump, and romp to be contented. She is a curious and alert cat.</p>

          <h1>What to expect</h1>
          <p>The Bengal is an active cat who is extremely athletic. If given adequate room for exercise, she can maintain her own weight without too much difficulty. The Bengal absolutely must have the ability to run and exercise freely. She is easy to keep groomed and enjoys her grooming.</p>
          <h1>History of the Bengal Cat</h1>
          <p>The beauty of wild cats has always been attractive to people, so efforts were made to breed one of the wild cats to a domestic cat in order to have a wild-appearing but gentle-tempered domestic cat. To this end, the first hybridization of the Asian Leopard cat and Domestic Tabby cats were undertaken in the early 1960s in the United States. This breeding program was suspended temporarily and then restarted in 1981 by Jean Mill and Dr. Willard Centerwall. Despite many obstacles in producing this hybrid, a wild-looking cat who achieved domesticity was the ultimate result of the breeding program. Since the wild cat used in the foundation of the breed was the Felis Bengalensis, the name of the breed became the Bengal. The Bengal began as a controversial breed, and, to some degree, remains one today. Some concerns are that more wild cats will be used in domestic breeding, and that the feral part of the Bengal cannot ever truly be bred out of the domestic cat. However, this may not be a major concern because of liberal outcrossing with domestic cats, and because cat registries prohibit having show Bengals be too closely related to their wild ancestors.</p>
