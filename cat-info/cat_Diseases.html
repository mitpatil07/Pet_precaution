    <h1 id="Worms"> Worms</h1>
    <p>Cats can acquire a variety of intestinal parasites, including some that are commonly referred to as “worms.”
      Infestations of intestinal worms can cause a variety of symptoms. Sometimes cats demonstrate few to no outward
      signs of infection, and the infestation can go undetected despite being a potentially serious health problem. Some
      feline parasitic worms are hazards for human health as well.<br>
    <h1>Common Types of Worms in Cats</h1>
    <p>Outdoor cats and those who are routinely exposed to soil where other animals defecate are prone to worms. Kittens
      and cats who do not receive regular preventative health care are most at risk for developing complications
      associated with internal parasites.<br>
      • Roundworms are the most common internal parasites in cats. Resembling spaghetti, adult worms are three to four
      inches long. There are several ways cats can become infected. Nursing kittens can get roundworms from an infected
      mother’s milk, while adult cats can acquire them by ingesting eggs from the feces of an infected cat.<br>
      • Hookworms are much smaller than roundworms—less than an inch long—and reside primarily in the small intestine.
      Because they feed on an animal’s blood, hookworms can cause life-threatening anemia, especially in kittens.
      Hookworm eggs are passed in the stool and hatch into larvae, and a cat can become infected either through
      ingestion or skin contact.<br>
      • Tapeworms are long, flat, segmented parasites that range from 4 to 28 inches in length. An infestation can cause
      vomiting or weight loss. Cats acquire tapeworms by ingesting an intermediate host, like an infected flea or
      rodent. When cats are infected, tapeworm segments—actual pieces of the worm that resemble grains of rice—can often
      be seen on the fur around a cat’s hind end.<br>
      • Lungworms reside in the lungs of a cat. Most cats will not show any signs of having lungworms, but some can
      develop a cough. Snails and slugs are popular intermediate hosts of this type of parasite, but cats are usually
      infected after eating a bird or rodent who has ingested an intermediate host.<br>
      • Though means of transmission can vary, one of the main ways that cats get worms is through the ingestion of the
      feces of infected felines. Mother cats can also pass on worms to their kittens.<br></p>
    <h1>Worm Prevention</h1>
    <p>• Keep your cat indoors to avoid exposure to infected cats, rodents, fleas and feces.
      • Make sure your home, yard and pets are flea-free.<br>
      • Practice good hygiene and wear gloves when changing cat litter or handling feces. It’s also important to
      frequently dispose of stool.<br>
      • Ask your veterinarian to recommend an appropriate internal parasite treatment or prevention program for your
      cat.<br></p>
    <h1>Symptoms of Worms in Cats</h1>
    <img src="cats_worm.webp" alt="">
    <p>Symptoms differ depending on the type of parasite and the location of infection, but some common clinical signs
      include:<br>
      • Diarrhea
      • Worms visible in stool or segments of worm seen near anus
      • Bloody stool
      • Bloating or round, potbellied appearance to abdomen
      • Weight loss
      • Vomiting
      • Constipation
      • Anemia
      • Coughing
      • Trouble breathing<br>
      If you think your cat may have worms, it’s important to bring her to a veterinarian, who can confirm the presence
      of worms. Avoid self-diagnosis, since worms are not always visible or identifiable.<br></p>
    <h1>Treatment for Worms</h1>

    <p> don’t attempt to treat your pet yourself—your cat should be treated for the specific type of worms he has.<br>

      • Not all dewormers eradicate all types of worms. Your veterinarian will determine the type of worm(s)
      infestation(s) your cat has, and prescribe the best course of treatment. Your veterinarian will also be able to
      tell you if the dewormer should be repeated, and when.<br>
      • Not all dog medications are safe for cats.<br>
      • Some over-the-counter deworming medications can be harmful if used inappropriately.<br></p>
    <h1>Transmission of Worms from Cats to Humans</h1>
    <p>A large number of roundworm eggs can accumulate where cats defecate. People, especially children, who ingest such
      eggs can develop serious health problems, such as blindness, encephalitis and other organ damage. Treatment of
      blindness caused by roundworm may involve surgical removal.
      Hookworm larvae can penetrate human skin and cause lesions. People can acquire tapeworms through the ingestion of
      an infected flea, although this is rare.</p>


  </div>
  <div class="info1">
    <h1 id="Ringworm">Ringworm</h1>
    <p>Although the name suggests otherwise, ringworm isn’t caused by a worm at all—but a fungus that can infect the
      skin, hair and nails. Not uncommon in cats, this highly contagious disease can lead to patchy, circular areas of
      hair loss with central red rings. Also known as dermatophytosis, ringworm often spreads to other pets in the
      household—and to humans, too.</p>
    <h1><strong>Ringworm Symptoms</strong></h1>
    <h1>Classic symptoms of ringworm in cats include:</h1>
    <p>• Skin lesions that typically appear on the head, ears and forelimbs.<br>
      • Ringworm can cause flaky bald patches that sometimes look red in the center.<br>
      • In mild cases, there may be localized areas of redness or simply dandruff, while more severe infections can
      spread over a cat’s entire body.<br>
      • It’s also possible for a pet to carry ringworm spores and not show any symptoms whatsoever.<br></p>
    <h1>Ringworm Transmission<br></h1>
    <p>A cat can get ringworm directly through contact with an infected animal—or indirectly through contact with
      bedding, dishes and other materials that have been contaminated with the skin cells or hairs of infected
      animals.<br> Ringworm spores are notoriously hardy and can survive in the environment for more than a year!<br>
      • Any cat can develop ringworm, but kittens less than a year old and geriatric cats are most prone to
      infection.<br>
      • Long-haired cats and those who are immunocompromised are also more susceptible.<br>
      • Ringworm can quickly spread in shelters or other crowded environments.<br>
      • Warm and humid conditions tend to promote ringworm infections.<br></p>
    <h1>Diagnosing Ringworm</h1>
    <p>Because infection can potentially spread over a cat’s body, it is important that you see your vet for an accurate
      diagnosis if you suspect your pet has ringworm. And because the infection can easily spread to you and other
      animals in the household, it’s a smart idea to immediately quarantine your cat until a veterinarian can confirm a
      diagnosis.<br> You should also thoroughly wash your hands after you touch your cat.<br>
      • Since some cats show few or no symptoms, a diagnosis of ringworm is rarely made just by looking at the skin.<br>
      • A veterinarian may use an ultraviolet light to diagnose ringworm, or may examine a fungal culture taken from a
      cat’s hair or skin cells.<br>
      • Skin biopsy and microscopic exam are sometimes also performed.<br></p>
    <h1>Treating Ringworm</h1>
    <h1><strong>Treatment of ringworm depends on the severity of the infection.<br></strong></h1>
    <p>• A veterinarian may prescribe a shampoo or ointment that contains a special medication to kill the fungus.<br>
      • In some cases, oral medications are necessary.<br>
      • To ensure that you’ve eradicated this resistant and hardy fungus, treatment may have to be given for several
      months or more and fungal cultures rechecked periodically.<br>
      • It’s also important to treat the cat’s environment to prevent infection from recurring.<br>
      If your veterinarian has diagnosed your cat with ringworm, he or she will explain what you must do to prevent the
      fungus from spreading to your other pets—and to the human members of the household.<br> But keep in mind that if
      you have other pets, it’s likely that most of them have been exposed as well.</p>
    <h2>Your veterinarian may recommend that you do the following:<br></h2>
    <p>• Bathe all pets in the household with a medicated rinse or shampoo.<br>
      • Wash the infected animals’ bedding and toys with a disinfectant that kills ringworm spores.<br>
      • Discard items that are impossible to thoroughly disinfect (carpeted cat trees, etc.)<br>
      • Frequently vacuum to rid the house of infected hairs and skin cells. (Yes, the fungus can survive on hair and
      skin that your cat sheds!)<br>
      • Thoroughly wash your hands after you bathe or touch your cat.<br>
      If a cat with ringworm is not properly treated, the lesions can spread over large areas of the animal’s body,
      causing hair loss and skin infections.<br></p>

  <div class="info2">
    <h1 id="Rabies">Rabies</h1>
    <p>Rabies is a viral disease that affects the brain and spinal cord of all mammals, including cats, dogs and
      humans.<br> This preventable disease has been reported in every state except Hawaii.<br> There’s good reason that
      the very word “rabies” evokes fear in people—once symptoms appear, rabies is close to 100% fatal.</p>
    <h1>Rabies Transmission</h1>
    <p><strong>There are several reported routes of transmission of the rabies virus.<br><br></strong>
      • Rabies is most often transmitted through a bite from an infected animal.<br>
      • Less frequently, it can be passed on when the saliva of an infected animal enters another animal’s body through
      mucous membranes or an open, fresh wound.<br>
      • The risk for contracting rabies runs highest if your cat is exposed to wild animals.<br> Outbreaks can occur in
      populations of wild animals (most often raccoons, bats, skunks and foxes in this country) or in areas where there
      are significant numbers of unvaccinated, free-roaming dogs and cats.<br>
      • In the United States, rabies is reported in cats more than in any other domestic species.<br>
      • Unvaccinated cats who are allowed to roam outdoors are at the highest risk for rabies infection.<br>
      • Feral cat populations remain a reservoir host for the rabies virus.<br></p>
    <h1>Rabies Prevention</h1>
    <p>• Vaccination is the key—and in many areas of the country, such as New York City, it's the law.<br>
      • Some local ordinances require lengthy quarantines—or euthanasia—of pets who have bitten someone if their owners
      do not have proof of current vaccination.<br>
      • Vaccinating your cat doesn't just protect her from rabies—it also protects your cat if she bites someone.<br>
      • In municipalities where rabies vaccinations for cats are not required, the decision to vaccinate is best left to
      the judgment of the veterinarian and the cat guardian because some cats experience serious side effects to the
      rabies vaccine.<br>
      • The vaccine should definitely be administered if your cat spends any time outdoors (ASPCA experts recommend
      keeping pet cats indoors).<br></p>
    <h1>Symptoms of Rabies</h1>
    <p>• Animals will not show signs immediately following exposure to a rabid animal. Symptoms can be varied and can
      take months to develop.<br> Classic signs of rabies in cats include:
      • Changes in behavior (including aggression, restlessness and lethargy),
      • Increased vocalization
      • Loss of appetite
      • Weakness
      • Disorientation
      • Paralysis
      • Seizures
      • Sudden death</p>
    <h1>Diagnosing Rabies</h1>
    <p>• There is no accurate test to diagnose rabies in live animals.<br>
      • The direct fluorescent antibody test is the most accurate test for diagnosis, but it can only be performed after
      the death of the animal.<br>
      • The rabies virus can incubate in a cat’s body anywhere from just one week to more than a year before the virus
      appears in the saliva and the cat is capable of transmitting the disease.<br>
      • When the animal becomes infectious, symptoms appear quickly.<br> It is possible for a cat, or dog, to shed the
      virus for several days before clinical signs appear.<br>
      • There is no treatment or cure for rabies once symptoms appear. The disease results in fatality.
      What to Do if Your Cat Interacts With a Rabid Animal<br>
      • Put gloves on to protect yourself from infection.<br>
      • Call your veterinarian for an immediate appointment!<br>
      • Contact local animal control officers if the animal who bit your pet is still at large; they will be best able
      to safely apprehend and remove the animal from the environment.<br>
      • A cat who is up to date with his vaccinations and who has been bitten by a possibly rabid animal should also be
      given a rabies booster vaccine immediately and kept under observation for 45 days.<br>
      • If you think you’ve been bitten by a rabid animal, see your doctor immediately!<br></p>
    <h1><strong>Note:</strong></h1>
    <p>Do not attempt to handle or capture a wild animal who is acting strangely (i.e., a nocturnal animal who is out
      during the day, an animal who acts unusually tame). Report the animal to local animal control officers as soon as
      possible.</p>
    <div class="info3">
      <h1 id="Heartworm">Heartworm</h1>
      <p>Spread by infected mosquitoes, heartworm is increasingly being recognized as an underlying cause of health
        problems in domestic cats.<br> Cats are an atypical host for heartworms. Despite its name, heartworm primarily
        causes lung disease in cats.<br> It is an important concern for any cat owner living in areas densely populated
        by mosquitoes, and prevention should be discussed with a veterinarian.<br>
        You may have thought heartworm disease only affects dogs, and it’s true that the infection is less common in
        cats.<br> The cat is not a natural host for the heartworm parasite, Dirofilaria immitis, and so the heartworm is
        not likely to complete its entire life cycle.<br> That means that fewer and smaller worms survive, and many do
        not reach a cat’s heart.<br> The worms that do survive—and the resulting immune reaction that the cat’s body
        sets up to kill the developing worms—can cause severe health problems.<br></p>
      <h1>Causes and Signs of Heartworm Disease</h1>
      <p>When a mosquito carrying the heartworm parasite, Dirofilaria immitis, bites a cat, larvae are transmitted into
        the bloodstream.<br> The larvae migrate toward the heart over a period of around four to six months, maturing as
        they go,<br> then settle in the heart, pulmonary arteries and blood vessels of the lungs. Because a domestic cat
        is not a natural host for the heartworm parasite, many of the worms die.<br> These—along with the living
        worms—cause severe inflammatory and immune responses in an infected cat.<br>
        Cats of all ages, living in any region, can contract heartworm, but the disease is more prevalent in felines who
        live in areas densely populated by mosquitoes.<br> Outdoor cats are at greater risk because of increased
        exposure to mosquitoes. However, indoor cats are also susceptible to mosquito bites,<br> so it’s smart to
        discuss prevention with your vet.<br> The heartworm infection can be especially life-threatening to kittens and
        older cats.</p>
      <h2>The following signs may indicate that your cat has been infected:<br></h2>
      <p>• Persistent cough<br>
        • Breathing difficulties (panting, wheezing, rapid or open-mouthed breathing)<br>
        • Depression<br>
        • Loss of appetite<br>
        • Weight loss<br>
        • Sporadic vomiting<br>
        • Lethargy<br>
        • Sudden death<br>
        Breathing difficulties that occur in the first stage of heartworm disease, caused by worms newly arriving in the
        heart and lungs, were likely previously diagnosed as feline asthma or bronchitis.<br> However, these breathing
        problems are now thought to have actually been due to what is now called heartworm-associated respiratory
        disease (HARD).<br></p>
      <h1>Heartworm Prevention</h1>
      <p>• There are several FDA-approved medications available that reliably prevent feline heartworm infection.<br>
        Check with your vet and please remember, it’s recommended that cats are screened for heartworm infection with
        blood tests before being given any type of preventative medication.<br>
        • It’s also a good idea to limit your cat’s exposure to mosquito-infested areas and bring her in for
        preventative screenings during vet visits.<br>
        • Regular checkups are key to detecting early infections and can give your cat a good chance at recovery.</p>
      <h1>Diagnosing Heartworm Disease</h1>

      <p>Heartworm disease is not as easily diagnosed in cats as it is in dogs.<br>
        • Routine testing requires a combination of blood tests.<br>
        • When cats show signs of respiratory difficulty and heartworm is suspected, diagnosis is usually based on a
        cat’s history,<br> physical examination, radiographs, echocardiogram and blood tests.</p>
      <h1>Treating Heartworm Disease<br></h1>
      <p>There are currently no products in the United States approved for treating feline heartworm infection.<br> The
        good news is that many heartworm-infected cats are able to fight the infection themselves,<br> and can be
        monitored with radiographs every few months, while waiting out the worms’ lifespan.<br> If an infected cat shows
        symptoms of lung disease, the cat can be given a cortisone-like medication as needed.<br> Medication can also be
        given to help control coughing and vomiting.<br>
        Although some cats are able to fight the infection on their own, the following can occur if heartworms are not
        monitored and treated:<br>
        • Damage to walls of heart<br>
        • Damage to pulmonary blood vessels<br>
        • Possible obstruction of blood flow through pulmonary arteries<br>
        • Impaired breathing<br>
        • Heart and lung failure<br>
        • Kidney and liver damage<br>
        • Sudden death<br></p>
    </div>

    <div class="info4">
      <h1 id="FIV">Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)</h1>
      <p>Cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) may not show symptoms until years after the initial
        infection occurred.<br> Although the virus is slow-acting, a cat’s immune system is severely weakened once the
        disease takes hold.<br> This makes the cat susceptible to various secondary infections. Infected cats receiving
        supportive medical care and kept in a stress-free,<br> indoor environment can live relatively comfortable lives
        for months to years before the disease reaches its chronic stages.<br>
        An FIV-infected cat may not show any symptoms for years.<br> Once symptoms do develop, however, they may
        continually progress—or a cat may show signs of sickness interspersed with health for years.<br> If your cat is
        demonstrating any of the following symptoms, please have examined by your veterinarian:<br>
        • Enlarged lymph nodes<br>
        • Fever<br>
        • Anemia<br>
        • Weight loss<br>
        • Disheveled coat<br>
        • Poor appetite<br>
        • Diarrhea<br>
        • Abnormal appearance or inflammation of the eye (conjunctivitis)<br>
        • Inflammation of the gums (gingivitis)<br>
        • Inflammation of the mouth (stomatitis)<br>
        • Dental disease<br>
        • Skin redness or hair loss<br>
        • Wounds that don’t heal<br>
        • Sneezing<br>
        • Discharge from eyes or nose<br>
        • Frequent urination, straining to urinate or urinating outside of litter box<br>
        • Behavior change<br></p>
      <h1>FIV Transmission</h1>
      <p>• FIV is mainly passed from cat to cat through deep bite wounds, the kind that usually occur outdoors during
        aggressive <br>fights and territorial disputes—a perfect reason to keep your cat inside.<br>
        • Another, less common mode of transmission is from an FIV-infected mother cat to her kitten.<br> FIV does not
        seem to be commonly spread through sharing food bowls and litter boxes,<br> social grooming, sneezing and other
        casual modes of contact.<br>
        • Although any feline is susceptible, free-roaming, outdoor intact male cats who fight most frequently contract
        the disease.<br> Cats who live indoors are the least likely to be infected.<br></p>
      <h2>Please note:</h2>
      <p> FIV cannot be transmitted from cat to human, only from cat to cat.<br></p>
      <h1>Preventing FIV</h1>
      <p>• The best way to prevent your cat from contracting the virus is to keep him indoors,<br> avoiding any chance
        of contact with infected felines.<br>
        • If you walk your cat, keep him on a leash when outdoors.<br>
        • If your cat is going to be spending any time in a cattery or in a home with other felines,<br> make sure all
        cats have tested negative for FIV.<br>
        • Any recently adopted cat should be tested for FIV prior to entering your home.<br>
        • You may also want to speak to your veterinarian about the FIV vaccine and if it is appropriate for your
        cat.<br>
      <h2>When to Consult Your Veterinarian<br></h2>
      <p>If you suspect your cat has FIV, have him examined and tested by your veterinarian right away.<br> During your
        visit, be ready to describe any symptoms that you have detected, no matter how minute they seem.<br> Also make
        sure to keep your cat indoors, away from other felines who <br>might possibly be infected or whom he could
        infect, until you have a diagnosis.<br>
        Without proper treatment, the secondary infections that can occur as a<br> consequence of FIV can progress to
        life-threatening conditions.<br> Additionally, cats with FIV can develop various forms of cancer, <br>blood
        diseases or kidney failure, which will ultimately claim the cat’s life.<br></p>
      <h1>Diagnosing FIV</h1>
      <p>• FIV infection is routinely diagnosed by blood testing.<br>
        • The FIV status of every cat should be known.<br>
        • The most common type of test looks for the presence of antibodies to the virus in the blood.<br> No test is
        100% accurate all of the time, and your veterinarian will<br> interpret the test result and determine whether
        further testing is needed to confirm either a positive or negative test result.<br> Once a cat is determined to
        be FIV-positive, that cat is capable of transmitting the disease to other cats.<br>
        • Since it is possible for an infected mother cat to transfer FIV antibodies to her kittens,<br> these kittens
        may test positive from their mother’s antibodies until they have cleared them from their systems,<br> which
        happens by six months of age. Kittens who test positive for FIV antibodies when they’re<br> younger than six
        months should undergo antibody tests again at a later date to see if they are infected.</p>
      <h1>FIV Treatment</h1>
      <p>Unfortunately,<br> there is no specific antiviral treatment for FIV.<br> Cats can carry the virus for a long
        time before symptoms appear. Therefore, treatment focuses mainly on extending the asymptomatic period or,<br> if
        symptoms have set in, on easing the secondary effects of the virus.<br> Your veterinarian may prescribe some of
        the following treatments:<br>
        • Medication for secondary infections<br>
        • Healthy, palatable diet to encourage good nutrition<br>
        • Fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy<br>
        • Anti-inflammatory drugs<br>
        • Immune-enhancing drugs<br>

      <h1>Caring for an FIV-Infected Cat<br></h1>
      <p>• Keep your cat indoors. This will protect him from contact with disease-causing agents to which he may be
        susceptible. By bringing your cat indoors,<br> you’re also protecting the uninfected cats in your community.<br>
        • Watch for changes—even seemingly minor—in your cat’s health and behavior. Immediately report any health
        concerns to your vet.<br>
        • Bring your cat to your vet at least twice per year for a wellness checkup, blood count and urine analysis.<br>
        • Feed your cat nutritionally balanced food—no raw food diets,<br> please, as bacteria and parasites in uncooked
        meat and eggs can be dangerous to immunocompromised pets.<br>
        • Be sure your cat is spayed or neutered.<br></p>

      <h1 id="FelV">Feline Leukemia Virus (FelV)</h1>
      <p>First discovered in the 1960s, feline leukemia virus is a transmittable RNA retrovirus that can severely
        inhibit a cat’s immune system.<br> It is one of the most commonly diagnosed causes of disease and death in
        domestic cats. Because the virus doesn’t always manifest symptoms right away,<br> any new cat entering a
        household—and any sick cat—should be tested for FeLV.<br>
        FeLV weakens an animal’s immune system and predisposes cats to a variety of infections and diseases,<br>
        including anemia, kidney disease and lymphosarcoma, a highly malignant and fatal cancer of the lymph system.<br>
        Young kittens and cats less than one year of age are most susceptible to the virus.<br> Cats living with an
        infected cat, allowed outdoors where they may be bitten by an infected cat,<br> and kittens born to a mother who
        is FeLV positive are most at risk for infection.<br>
        • The FeLV virus is shed in many bodily fluids, including saliva, nasal secretions, urine, feces and blood.<br>
        • FeLV is most commonly transmitted through direct contact, mutual grooming and through sharing litter boxes,
        food and water bowls.<br>
        • It can also be passed in utero or through mother’s milk.<br>
        • Infected outdoor cats fighting with other cats can transmit the disease through bites and scratches.<br>
        Healthy cats over three months of age and vaccinated for FeLV are highly unlikely to contract the virus from
        another cat.<br> </p>
      <h1>Signs of FeLV</h1>
      <h2>Cats can be infected and show no signs. Others may exhibit:</h2>
      <p>• Loss of appetite and weight loss<br>
        • Pale or inflamed gums<br>
        • Poor coat condition<br>
        • Abcesses<br>
        • Fever<br>
        • Upper respiratory infections<br>
        • Diarrhea and vomiting<br>
        • Seizures<br>
        • Changes in behavior<br>
        • Vision or other eye problems<br>
        • Enlarged lymph nodes<br>
        • Reproductive problems (in females)<br>
        • Jaundice<br>
        • Chronic skin disease<br>
        • Respiratory distress<br>
        • Lethargy<br></p>
      <h1>Preventing FelV</h1>
      <p>• There is a vaccine available for cats who are at risk of contracting FeLV. Like all vaccines,<br> there are
        risks involved in vaccination, and the vaccine is not a 100% guarantee against infection.<br> Your veterinarian
        can best evaluate whether this vaccine is right for your cat.<br>
        • As with any infectious disease, the best prevention is eliminating sources of exposure.<br> Routine FeLV
        testing and keeping your cat indoors and away from cats whose FeLV status is not known <br>remain the best way
        to prevent your cat from becoming infected.<br></p>
      <h1>Diagnosing FelV</h1>
      <h2>There are several types of tests available to diagnose FeLV.</h2>
      <p>• Most veterinarians and shelter professionals use the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test,<br>
        which detects antigen to the FELV virus in the bloodstream.<br>
        • Other tests like the IFA (indirect fluorescent antibody) test or PCR (polymerase chain reaction)<br> test are
        recommended to confirm positive ELISA test results.<br></p>
      <h1>for a Cat with FelV</h1>
      <p>• Feed your cat a nutritionally balanced diet, one free of raw meat, eggs and unpasteurized dairy products,
        <br>which can harbor bacteria and parasites and lead to infection.<br>
        • Provide a quiet place for your cat to rest indoors and away from other cats who could promote disease.<br>
        • Bring your cat to the vet every six months—at the very least—for a wellness checkup and blood tests.<br>
        • During the early stages of infection, a cat may not show any clinical signs, but he can still pass the<br>
        virus to other cats. It’s not advisable to introduce a new uninfected cat into the household,<br> even one who
        has been properly vaccinated against FeLV.<br> Those living in close quarters with infected cats are most at
        risk for infection,<br> and should be tested for the virus and, if negative, be housed separately.<br>
        • FeLV is contagious to other cats, but not to humans or other species.<br> Other cats in the house can acquire
        the virus from an infected cat. <br>Though the virus doesn’t live long outside of the body, and is easily
        inactivated with common disinfectants,<br> it can be passed through mutual grooming, shared food and water as
        well as common litter boxes.<br>
        • Sadly there is no cure for FeLV, and it is estimated that less than 20% of clinically <br>infected cats
        survive more than three years of active infection. In the case of those cats who develop cancer,<br>
        chemotherapy can help prolong life, but treatment often focuses on providing the best quality of life.<br>
