Additionally, their calm nature can make them easier to handle during tasks such as milking or veterinary procedures</p>

          <p>n the 20th century, the Alentejana breed faced challenges due to changes in agricultural practices and the introduction of more specialized cattle breeds. However, efforts to preserve and promote indigenous Portuguese breeds, including the Alentejana, have led to renewed interest and recognition of their value.

Efforts to conserve and promote the breed continue through breeding programs, genetic conservation initiatives, and the promotion of traditional husbandry practices. The breed's adaptability, resilience, and genetic diversity make it an important asset for sustainable agriculture and biodiversity conservation in Portugal and beyond.</p>
