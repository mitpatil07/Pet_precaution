          <h1>Golden personality</h1>
          <p>The golden retriever is even-tempered, intelligent and affectionate. Golden retrievers are playful, yet gentle with children, and they tend to get along well with other pets and strangers.These dogs are eager to please, which probably explains why they respond so well to obedience training and are such popular service dogs. They also like to work, whether it involves hunting birds or fetching their guardian's slippers..Golden retrievers are not often barkers, and they lack guard instincts, so do not count on them to make good watchdogs. However, some golden retrievers will let you know when strangers are approaching.</p>

          <h1>What to expect</h1>
          <p>This breed likes to be active. Remember, golden retrievers are bird dogs at heart, so they love a good game of fetch or a swim. If exercise is provided daily, golden retrievers can adapt to any type of home, even if it is a city apartment.Golden retrievers are considered average shedders. Brushing about once weekly will keep the coat looking nice.</p>

          <h1>History of the Golden</h1>
          <p>In 1999, the golden retriever was the second most popular AKC breed. This ranking is no surprise, because the dog has many qualities that make for a perfect family pet. The golden retriever's roots are in the fields and waterways of Great Britain, however.The golden retriever was bred to be a bird dog, particularly for hunting water fowl, and the breed resulted from crossing a number of other breeds thought to include spaniels, setters, and the Newfoundland (but not the Newfoundland we know today), and perhaps even a bloodhound. The combination created a hardy, strong swimming dog that could withstand cold water, track wounded game and deal with crippled birds.Today, golden retrievers are not only good bird dogs and family pets they also are popular as service dogs for the blind and disabled, and as search and rescue dogs and contraband detection dogs. Few dogs can claim this breed's versatility.</p>
