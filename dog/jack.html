          <h1>What to expect</h1>
          <p>
            Given the personality of the Jack Russell, this breed is not for everyone. The hunting instinct cannot be trained out of the breed.

          <h1>History of the Jack</h1>
          <p>The Jack Russell terrier is a true working terrier. The breed takes its name from the Reverend John Russell, who bred one of the finest strains of terriers for working fox in England. The Jack Russell is a baying terrier, meaning the dog should flush out the fox with his steady barking but is never to kill his prey. The Jack Russell has been strictly bred for hunting since its beginning in the early 1800s.Because of their broad genetic make-up, there is some variance in the standard of Jack Russell terriers. In fact, disagreement about leg length has caused the breed to be divided into separate breeds in England, where the longer legged dogs are called Parson Jack Russell terriers and the shorter legged dogs are called simply Jack Russell terriers.In America, despite the greater popularity of the short legged dogs, the long legged dogs are the breed officially recognized as the Jack Russell terrier. The breed has been popular with the horse crowd for years.Media exposure, especially the popularity of Moose, the terrier who plays Eddie on the television show Frasier, and Soccer, who stars in the children's show Wishbone, have catapulted the breed to popularity.The Jack Russell terrier is a newer member of the AKC terrier group, but that membership came amid protests from fanciers who feared AKC recognition was not good for the breed. The result is that two national associations exist for the breed, the original Jack Russell Terrier Club of America, and the newer AKC recognized Jack Russell Terrier Association of America.</p>
