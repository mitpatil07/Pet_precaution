    <h1>Feeding</h1> 
    <img src="dog_feeding.jpg" alt="">
    <p>• Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day.<br>
      • Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day.<br>
      • Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day.<br>
      • When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually enough.<br><br>
     
      • For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's better to feed two smaller meals.<br>
      Premium-quality dry food provides a well-balanced diet for adult dogs and may be mixed with water,<br> broth or
      canned food. Your dog may enjoy cottage cheese, cooked egg or fruits and vegetables,<br> but these additions
      should not total more than ten percent of his daily food intake.<br>
      Puppies should be fed a high-quality, brand-name puppy food (large breed puppy foods for large breeds).<br> Please
      limit "people food," however, because it can result in vitamin and mineral imbalances,<br> bone and teeth problems
      and may cause very picky eating habits and obesity.<br> Clean, fresh water should be available at all times, and
      be sure to wash food and water dishes frequently.</p>
    <h1>Exercise</h1>
    <img src="dog_exersize.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Dogs need exercise to burn calories, stimulate their minds, and stay healthy.<br> Individual exercise needs vary
      based on breed or breed mix, sex, age and level of health.<br> Exercise also tends to help dogs avoid boredom,
      which can lead to destructive behaviors.<br> Supervised fun and games will satisfy many of your pet's instinctual
      urges to dig, herd, chew, retrieve and chase.,<br></p>
    <h1>Grooming</h1>
    <img src="grooming-dog.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Help keep your dog clean and reduce shedding with frequent brushing.<br> Check for fleas and ticks daily during
      warm weather.<br> Most dogs don't need to be bathed more than a few times a year.<br> Before bathing, comb or cut
      out all mats from the coat.<br> Carefully rinse all soap out of the coat, or the dirt will stick to soap
      residue.<br></p>
    <h1>Handling</h1>
    <img src="dog_handling.webp" alt="">
    <p> To carry a puppy or small dog, place one hand under the dog's chest,<br> with either your forearm or other hand
      supporting the hind legs and rump.<br> Never attempt to lift or grab your puppy or small dog by the forelegs, tail
      or back of the neck.<br> If you do have to lift a large dog, lift from the underside, supporting his chest with
      one arm and his rear end with the other.<br></p>
    <h1>Housing</h1>
    <img src="dog_house.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>Your pet needs a warm, quiet place to rest, away from all drafts and off the floor.<br> A training crate or dog
      bed is ideal, with a clean blanket or pillow placed inside. Wash the dog's bedding often.<br> If your dog will be
      spending a lot of time outdoors, be sure she has access to shade and <br>plenty of cool water in hot weather, and
      a warm, dry, covered shelter when it's cold.</p>

    <h1>Fleas and Ticks</h1>
    <img src="doggggg.webp" alt="">
    <p>Daily inspections of your dog for fleas and ticks during the warm seasons are important.<br> Use a flea comb to
      find and remove fleas. There are several new methods of flea and tick control<br>. Speak to your veterinarian
      about these and other options.</p>
    <h1>Medicines and Poisons</h1>
    <img src="dog_toxic.webp" alt="">
    <p>Never give your dog medication that has not been prescribed by a veterinarian. If you suspect that your animal
      has ingested a poisonous substance, call your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center for 24-hour
      animal poison information at (888) 426- 4435.</p>
    <h1>Spaying and Neutering</h1>
    <img src="dog_spay.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Female dogs should be spayed and male dogs neutered by six months of age.<br></p>
    <h1>Vaccinations</h1>
    <img src="dog_vacsine.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Your dog may benefit from receiving a number of vaccinations.</p>
