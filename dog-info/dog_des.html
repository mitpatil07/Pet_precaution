    <h1 id="Viral"> Infections:- Viral Infection</h1>
    <p>Rabies (hydrophobia) is a fatal viral disease that can affect any mammal, although the close
      relationship of dogs with humans makes canine rabies a zoonotic concern. Vaccination of
      dogs for rabies is commonly required by law. Please see the article dog health for information
      on this disease in dogs.
      Canine parvovirus is a sometimes fatal gastrointestinal infection that mainly affects puppies.
      It occurs worldwide.
      Canine coronavirus is a gastrointestinal disease that is usually asymptomatic or with mild
      clinical signs. The signs are worse in puppies.
      Canine distemper is an often fatal infectious disease that mainly has respiratory and
      neurological signs.
      Canine influenza is a newly emerging infectious respiratory disease. Up to 80 percent of dogs
      infected will have symptoms, but the mortality rate is only 5 to 8 percent.
      Infectious canine hepatitis is a sometimes fatal infectious disease of the liver.[6]
      Canine herpesvirus is an infectious disease that is a common cause of death in puppies less
      than three weeks old.</p>
    <img src="1-1-1.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Pseudorabies (Morbus Aujeszky) is an infectious disease that primarily affects swine, but can
      also cause a fatal disease in dogs with signs similar to rabies.[8]
      Canine minute virus is an infectious disease that can cause respiratory and gastrointestinal
      signs in young puppies.</p>
    <h1>Bacterial infections</h1>
    <p>Brucellosis is a sexually transmitted bacterial disease that can cause uveitis, abortion, and
      orchitis in dogs.
      Leptospirosis is an infectious disease caused by a spirochaete. Symptoms include liver and
      kidney failure and vasculitis.
      Lyme disease is a disease caused Borrelia burgdorferi, a spirochaete, and spread by ticks of
      the genus Ixodes. Symptoms in dogs include acute arthritis, anorexia and lethargy. There is
      no rash as is typically seen in humans.

      Ehrlichiosis is a disease caused by Ehrlichia canis and spread by the brown dog tick,
      Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Signs include fever, vasculitis, and low blood counts.</p>
    <img src="bactdog.jpg" alt="">

    <p>Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a rickettsial disease that occurs in dogs and humans. It is
      caused by Rickettsia rickettsii and spread by ticks of the genus Dermacentor. Signs are similar
      to human disease, including anorexia, fever, and thrombocytopenia.
      Clostridium species are a potential cause of diarrhea in dogs. Associated species include C.
      perfringens and C. difficile.
      Kennel cough is an infectious respiratory disease which can be caused by one of several
      viruses or by Bordetella bronchiseptica. Ivasculitis most commonly occurs in dogs in close
      confinement such as kennels</p>
    <h1>Fungal Infection</h1>
    <p>Blastomycosis is a fungal disease caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis that affects both dogs
      and humans. Dogs are ten times more likely to be infected than humans. The disease in dogs
      can affect the eyes, brain, lungs, skin, or bones.
      Histoplasmosis* is a fungal disease caused by Histoplasma capsulatum that affects both dogs
      and humans. The disease in dogs usually affects the lungs and small intestine.
      Coccidioidomycosisis a fungal disease caused by Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides
      posadasii. that affects a variety of species, including dogs. In dogs signs of primary
      pulmonary disease include a cough, fever, weight loss, anorexia, and lethargy. Disseminated
      disease occurs when the fungus has spread outside of the lungs and may include clinical signs
      such as lameness, pain, seizures, anterior uveitis, and localized swelling. Diagnosis of Valley
      Fever may include multiple tests, including serology and radiology. According to a study
      performed in the Tucson and Phoenix area, 28% of dogs will test positive for exposure to the
      fungus by two years of age, but only 6% of the dogs will be ill with clinical disease. There is an
      increased risk of infection associated with amount of time spent outdoors, a larger roaming
      space accessed by the dog, and increasing age.
      Cryptococcosisis a fungal disease caused by Cryptococcus neoformans that affects both dogs
      and humans. It is a rare disease in dogs, with cats seven to ten times more likely to be
      infected. The disease in dogs can affect the lungs and skin, but more commonly the eye and
      central nervous system.</p>
    <img src="fungaldog.webp" alt="">
    <p> Ringworm is a fungal skin disease that in dogs is caused by Microsporum canis (70%),
      Microsporum gypseum (20%), and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (10%). Typical signs in dogs
      include hair loss and scaly skin.
      Sporotrichosis is a fungal disease caused by Sporothrix schenckii that affects both dogs and
      humans. It is a rare disease in dogs, with cat and horse infections predominating in veterinary
      medicine. The disease in dogs is usually nodular skin lesions of the head and trunk.

      Aspergillosisis a fungal disease that in dogs is caused primarily by Aspergillus fumigatus.
      Infection is usually in the nasal cavity. Typical signs in dogs include sneezing, nasal discharge,
      bleeding from the nose, and ulcerations of the nose.
      Pythiosis is a disease caused by a water mould of the genus Pythium, P. insidiosum. It occurs
      primarily in dogs and horses, but can also affect humans. In dogs it affects the
      gastrointestinal system and lymph nodes, and rarely the skin.
      Mucormycosis is a collection of fungal and mold diseases in dogs including pythiosis,
      zygomycosis, and lagenidiosis that affect the gastrointestinal tract and skin.</p>

  <div class="info1">
    <h1 id="Parasites">Parasites:- Internal parasites (endoparasites)</h1>
    <p>Heartworm disease is caused by Dirofilaria immitis, which uses the mosquito as its vector.
      Heartworms live in the pulmonary artery and right ventricle of the heart. Heartworm disease

      in dogs is spread by mosquitoes that harbor the parasite Dirofilaria immitis. Signs include
      cough, difficulty breathing, and death.
      Gnathostomiasis is a disease from mammal feces and undercooked seafood.
      Intestinal parasites
      Hookworms are a common parasite of dogs. The most common is Ancylostoma caninum,
      followed by Uncinaria stenocephala and A. braziliense. Signs include diarrhea, vomiting, and
      weight loss.</p>
    <img src="common-external-and-internal-parasites.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
      Tapeworms are also common and in the dog are usually Dipylidium caninum, which is spread
      by ingesting fleas and lice. Also common is Taenia pisiformis, spread by ingesting rabbits and
      rodents. Rare tapeworm infections are caused by species of the genera Echinococcus,
      Mesocestoides, and Spirometra. There are usually no symptoms.
      Toxocariasis is an infection of Toxocara canis or Toxascaris leonina. Signs are usually mild,
      but may include diarrhea, pot-bellied appearance, poor growth, and vomiting.
      Whipworms are parasites that live in the cecum and large intestine. The canine whipworm is
      Trichuris vulpis.</p>
    <h1>External parasites (ectoparasites)</h1>
    <p>Ticks are an external parasite of the dog and can spread diseases such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted
      fever, babesiosis, and ehrlichiosis. They can also cause a neurological disorder known as tick paralysis. </p>
    <img src="doggggg.webp" alt="">

    <p>Mites Ear mites are microscopic members of the species Otodectes cynotis. Symptoms include itching, inflammation,
      and black debris in the ear.
      Cheyletiellosis is a mild pruritic skin disease caused by Cheyletiella yasguri. Humans can be transiently
      infected.
      Chiggers, also known as harvest mites, can cause itching, redness and crusting of the skin.
      Demodicosis, also known as demodectic mange, is caused by Demodex canis mites which live in small numbers in
      sebaceous glands and hair follicles. These mites can cause inflammation and hair loss, and may also lead to
      secondary bacterial infections such as fever, lethargy, and enlarged lymph nodes.
      Sarcoptic mange is caused by Sarcoptes scabiei canis. Signs include intense itching and scaling, and is contagious
      to humans. </p>

      <h1 id="Rabies">Diseases and disorders by system<br>
        Skeletal and muscular disorders
      </h1>
      <p>Hip dysplasia is an inherited disease in dogs that is characterized by abnormal development of the acetabulum
        and head of the femur. It is more common in large breeds.
        Elbow dysplasia is a condition found more commonly in large breeds. It incorporates several different hereditary
        conditions of the elbow, including osteochondritis of the medial condyle of the humerus, fragmentation of the
        medial coronoid process of the ulna, and ununited anconeal process of the ulna.<br>
        • Luxating patella is a medial or lateral displacement of the patella, or kneecap. It is strongly suspected to
        be inherited, but can also result from trauma.[36] It is more common in smaller breeds of dogs<br>
        • Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is separation of immature articular cartilage from underlying bone. It is
        caused by osteochondrosis, which is characterized by abnormal endochondral ossification of epiphyseal cartilage.
        It is most commonly seen in the stifle, elbow, shoulder, and hock.<br></p>
      <img src="dogbon.webp" alt="">
      <p>• Panosteitis is a common disease of unknown cause that causes pain and a shifting leg lameness in medium and
        large breed dogs. It affects the long bones of the hind and forelimbs.<br>
        • Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also known as Perthes disease or avascular necrosis of the femoral head, is
        characterized by a deformity of the head of the femur and hip pain. It occurs in small-breed puppies.<br>
        • Back pain in dogs, particularly in long-backed breeds, such as Basset Hounds and Dachshunds, is usually caused
        by intervertebral disk disease. It is caused by degeneration and protrusion of the disk and compression of the
        spinal cord. It occurs most commonly in the cervical and thoracolumbar regions. Signs include back pain, hind
        limb weakness, and paralysis.<br>
        • Congenital vertebral anomalies, including butterfly, block, and transitional vertebrae, and hemivertebrae, are
        a collection of malformations of the spine in animals. Most are not clinically significant, but they can cause
        compression of the spinal cord by deforming the vertebral canal or causing instability.<br>
        • Craniomandibular osteopathy is a hereditary disease in West Highland White Terriers and also occurs in other
        terrier breeds. It is a developmental disease in puppies causing extensive bony changes in the mandible and
        skull. Signs include pain upon opening the mouth.<br></p>
      <img src="dog_dess.png" alt="">
      <p>• Hypertrophic osteopathy is a bone disease secondary to disease in the lungs. It is characterized by new bone
        formation on the outside of the long bones.<br>
        • Hypertrophic osteodystrophy is a bone disease in rapidly growing large breed dogs. Signs include swelling of
        the metaphysis (the part of the bone adjacent to the joint), pain, depression, loss of appetite, and fever. The
        disease is usually bilateral in the limb bones.<br>
        • Spondylosis, known as spondylosis deformans in dogs, is growth of osteophytes on the ventral and lateral
        surfaces of the vertebral bodies. It is usually an incidental finding on radiographs and rarely causes
        symptoms.<br>
        • Masticatory muscle myositis (MMM) is an inflammatory disease in dogs affecting the muscles of the jaw. Signs
        include swelling of the jaw muscles and pain on opening the mouth. In chronic MMM there is atrophy of the jaw
        muscles, and scarring of the masticatory muscles due to fibrosis may result in inability to open the mouth
        (trismus).<br></p>
      <h1>Rabies Transmission</h1>
      <p><strong>There are several reported routes of transmission of the rabies virus.<br><br></strong>
        • Rabies is most often transmitted through a bite from an infected animal.<br>
        • Less frequently, it can be passed on when the saliva of an infected animal enters another animal’s body
        through mucous membranes or an open, fresh wound.<br>
        • The risk for contracting rabies runs highest if your cat is exposed to wild animals.<br> Outbreaks can occur
        in populations of wild animals (most often raccoons, bats, skunks and foxes in this country) or in areas where
        there are significant numbers of unvaccinated, free-roaming dogs and cats.<br>
        • In the United States, rabies is reported in cats more than in any other domestic species.<br>
        • Unvaccinated cats who are allowed to roam outdoors are at the highest risk for rabies infection.<br>
        • Feral cat populations remain a reservoir host for the rabies virus.<br></p>
      <h1>Rabies Prevention</h1>
      <p>• Vaccination is the key—and in many areas of the country, such as New York City, it's the law.<br>
        • Some local ordinances require lengthy quarantines—or euthanasia—of pets who have bitten someone if their
        owners do not have proof of current vaccination.<br>
        • Vaccinating your cat doesn't just protect her from rabies—it also protects your cat if she bites someone.<br>
        • In municipalities where rabies vaccinations for cats are not required, the decision to vaccinate is best left
        to the judgment of the veterinarian and the cat guardian because some cats experience serious side effects to
        the rabies vaccine.<br>
        • The vaccine should definitely be administered if your cat spends any time outdoors (ASPCA experts recommend
        keeping pet cats indoors).<br></p>
      <h1>Symptoms of Rabies</h1>
      <p>• Animals will not show signs immediately following exposure to a rabid animal. Symptoms can be varied and can
        take months to develop.<br> Classic signs of rabies in cats include:
        • Changes in behavior (including aggression, restlessness and lethargy),
        • Increased vocalization
        • Loss of appetite
        • Weakness
        • Disorientation
        • Paralysis
        • Seizures
        • Sudden death</p>
      <h1>Diagnosing Rabies</h1>
      <p>• There is no accurate test to diagnose rabies in live animals.<br>
        • The direct fluorescent antibody test is the most accurate test for diagnosis, but it can only be performed
        after the death of the animal.<br>
        • The rabies virus can incubate in a cat’s body anywhere from just one week to more than a year before the virus
        appears in the saliva and the cat is capable of transmitting the disease.<br>
        • When the animal becomes infectious, symptoms appear quickly.<br> It is possible for a cat, or dog, to shed the
        virus for several days before clinical signs appear.<br>
        • There is no treatment or cure for rabies once symptoms appear. The disease results in fatality.
        What to Do if Your Cat Interacts With a Rabid Animal<br>
        • Put gloves on to protect yourself from infection.<br>
        • Call your veterinarian for an immediate appointment!<br>
        • Contact local animal control officers if the animal who bit your pet is still at large; they will be best able
        to safely apprehend and remove the animal from the environment.<br>
        • A cat who is up to date with his vaccinations and who has been bitten by a possibly rabid animal should also
        be given a rabies booster vaccine immediately and kept under observation for 45 days.<br>
        • If you think you’ve been bitten by a rabid animal, see your doctor immediately!<br></p>
      <h1><strong>Note:</strong></h1>
      <p>Do not attempt to handle or capture a wild animal who is acting strangely (i.e., a nocturnal animal who is out
        during the day, an animal who acts unusually tame). Report the animal to local animal control officers as soon
        as possible.</p>

    <div class="info3">
      <h1 id="Heartworm">Heartworm</h1>
      <p>Spread by infected mosquitoes, heartworm is increasingly being recognized as an underlying cause of health
        problems in domestic cats.<br> Cats are an atypical host for heartworms. Despite its name, heartworm primarily
        causes lung disease in cats.<br> It is an important concern for any cat owner living in areas densely populated
        by mosquitoes, and prevention should be discussed with a veterinarian.<br>
        You may have thought heartworm disease only affects dogs, and it’s true that the infection is less common in
        cats.<br> The cat is not a natural host for the heartworm parasite, Dirofilaria immitis, and so the heartworm is
        not likely to complete its entire life cycle.<br> That means that fewer and smaller worms survive, and many do
        not reach a cat’s heart.<br> The worms that do survive—and the resulting immune reaction that the cat’s body
        sets up to kill the developing worms—can cause severe health problems.<br></p>
      <h1>Causes and Signs of Heartworm Disease</h1>
      <p>When a mosquito carrying the heartworm parasite, Dirofilaria immitis, bites a cat, larvae are transmitted into
        the bloodstream.<br> The larvae migrate toward the heart over a period of around four to six months, maturing as
        they go,<br> then settle in the heart, pulmonary arteries and blood vessels of the lungs. Because a domestic cat
        is not a natural host for the heartworm parasite, many of the worms die.<br> These—along with the living
        worms—cause severe inflammatory and immune responses in an infected cat.<br>
        Cats of all ages, living in any region, can contract heartworm, but the disease is more prevalent in felines who
        live in areas densely populated by mosquitoes.<br> Outdoor cats are at greater risk because of increased
        exposure to mosquitoes. However, indoor cats are also susceptible to mosquito bites,<br> so it’s smart to
        discuss prevention with your vet.<br> The heartworm infection can be especially life-threatening to kittens and
        older cats.</p>
      <h2>The following signs may indicate that your cat has been infected:<br></h2>
      <p>• Persistent cough<br>
        • Breathing difficulties (panting, wheezing, rapid or open-mouthed breathing)<br>
        • Depression<br>
        • Loss of appetite<br>
        • Weight loss<br>
        • Sporadic vomiting<br>
        • Lethargy<br>
        • Sudden death<br>
        Breathing difficulties that occur in the first stage of heartworm disease, caused by worms newly arriving in the
        heart and lungs, were likely previously diagnosed as feline asthma or bronchitis.<br> However, these breathing
        problems are now thought to have actually been due to what is now called heartworm-associated respiratory
        disease (HARD).<br></p>
      <h1>Heartworm Prevention</h1>
      <p>• There are several FDA-approved medications available that reliably prevent feline heartworm infection.<br>
        Check with your vet and please remember, it’s recommended that cats are screened for heartworm infection with
        blood tests before being given any type of preventative medication.<br>
        • It’s also a good idea to limit your cat’s exposure to mosquito-infested areas and bring her in for
        preventative screenings during vet visits.<br>
        • Regular checkups are key to detecting early infections and can give your cat a good chance at recovery.</p>
      <h1>Diagnosing Heartworm Disease</h1>

      <p>Heartworm disease is not as easily diagnosed in cats as it is in dogs.<br>
        • Routine testing requires a combination of blood tests.<br>
        • When cats show signs of respiratory difficulty and heartworm is suspected, diagnosis is usually based on a
        cat’s history,<br> physical examination, radiographs, echocardiogram and blood tests.</p>
      <h1>Treating Heartworm Disease<br></h1>
      <p>There are currently no products in the United States approved for treating feline heartworm infection.<br> The
        good news is that many heartworm-infected cats are able to fight the infection themselves,<br> and can be
        monitored with radiographs every few months, while waiting out the worms’ lifespan.<br> If an infected cat shows
        symptoms of lung disease, the cat can be given a cortisone-like medication as needed.<br> Medication can also be
        given to help control coughing and vomiting.<br>
        Although some cats are able to fight the infection on their own, the following can occur if heartworms are not
        monitored and treated:<br>
        • Damage to walls of heart<br>
        • Damage to pulmonary blood vessels<br>
        • Possible obstruction of blood flow through pulmonary arteries<br>
        • Impaired breathing<br>
        • Heart and lung failure<br>
        • Kidney and liver damage<br>
        • Sudden death<br></p>

      <h1 id="FIV">Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)</h1>
      <p>Cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) may not show symptoms until years after the initial
        infection occurred.<br> Although the virus is slow-acting, a cat’s immune system is severely weakened once the
        disease takes hold.<br> This makes the cat susceptible to various secondary infections. Infected cats receiving
        supportive medical care and kept in a stress-free,<br> indoor environment can live relatively comfortable lives
        for months to years before the disease reaches its chronic stages.<br>
        An FIV-infected cat may not show any symptoms for years.<br> Once symptoms do develop, however, they may
        continually progress—or a cat may show signs of sickness interspersed with health for years.<br> If your cat is
        demonstrating any of the following symptoms, please have examined by your veterinarian:<br>
        • Enlarged lymph nodes<br>
        • Fever<br>
        • Anemia<br>
        • Weight loss<br>
        • Disheveled coat<br>
        • Poor appetite<br>
        • Diarrhea<br>
        • Abnormal appearance or inflammation of the eye (conjunctivitis)<br>
        • Inflammation of the gums (gingivitis)<br>
        • Inflammation of the mouth (stomatitis)<br>
        • Dental disease<br>
        • Skin redness or hair loss<br>
        • Wounds that don’t heal<br>
        • Sneezing<br>
        • Discharge from eyes or nose<br>
        • Frequent urination, straining to urinate or urinating outside of litter box<br>
        • Behavior change<br></p>
      <h1>FIV Transmission</h1>
      <p>• FIV is mainly passed from cat to cat through deep bite wounds, the kind that usually occur outdoors during
        aggressive <br>fights and territorial disputes—a perfect reason to keep your cat inside.<br>
        • Another, less common mode of transmission is from an FIV-infected mother cat to her kitten.<br> FIV does not
        seem to be commonly spread through sharing food bowls and litter boxes,<br> social grooming, sneezing and other
        casual modes of contact.<br>
        • Although any feline is susceptible, free-roaming, outdoor intact male cats who fight most frequently contract
        the disease.<br> Cats who live indoors are the least likely to be infected.<br></p>
      <h2>Please note:</h2>
      <p> FIV cannot be transmitted from cat to human, only from cat to cat.<br></p>
      <h1>Preventing FIV</h1>
      <p>• The best way to prevent your cat from contracting the virus is to keep him indoors,<br> avoiding any chance
        of contact with infected felines.<br>
        • If you walk your cat, keep him on a leash when outdoors.<br>
        • If your cat is going to be spending any time in a cattery or in a home with other felines,<br> make sure all
        cats have tested negative for FIV.<br>
        • Any recently adopted cat should be tested for FIV prior to entering your home.<br>
        • You may also want to speak to your veterinarian about the FIV vaccine and if it is appropriate for your
        cat.<br>
      <h2>When to Consult Your Veterinarian<br></h2>
      <p>If you suspect your cat has FIV, have him examined and tested by your veterinarian right away.<br> During your
        visit, be ready to describe any symptoms that you have detected, no matter how minute they seem.<br> Also make
        sure to keep your cat indoors, away from other felines who <br>might possibly be infected or whom he could
        infect, until you have a diagnosis.<br>
        Without proper treatment, the secondary infections that can occur as a<br> consequence of FIV can progress to
        life-threatening conditions.<br> Additionally, cats with FIV can develop various forms of cancer, <br>blood
        diseases or kidney failure, which will ultimately claim the cat’s life.<br></p>
      <h1>Diagnosing FIV</h1>
      <p>• FIV infection is routinely diagnosed by blood testing.<br>
        • The FIV status of every cat should be known.<br>
        • The most common type of test looks for the presence of antibodies to the virus in the blood.<br> No test is
        100% accurate all of the time, and your veterinarian will<br> interpret the test result and determine whether
        further testing is needed to confirm either a positive or negative test result.<br> Once a cat is determined to
        be FIV-positive, that cat is capable of transmitting the disease to other cats.<br>
        • Since it is possible for an infected mother cat to transfer FIV antibodies to her kittens,<br> these kittens
        may test positive from their mother’s antibodies until they have cleared them from their systems,<br> which
        happens by six months of age. Kittens who test positive for FIV antibodies when they’re<br> younger than six
        months should undergo antibody tests again at a later date to see if they are infected.</p>
      <h1>FIV Treatment</h1>
      <p>Unfortunately,<br> there is no specific antiviral treatment for FIV.<br> Cats can carry the virus for a long
        time before symptoms appear. Therefore, treatment focuses mainly on extending the asymptomatic period or,<br> if
        symptoms have set in, on easing the secondary effects of the virus.<br> Your veterinarian may prescribe some of
        the following treatments:<br>
        • Medication for secondary infections<br>
        • Healthy, palatable diet to encourage good nutrition<br>
        • Fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy<br>
        • Anti-inflammatory drugs<br>
        • Immune-enhancing drugs<br>
        • Parasite control<br></p>
      <h1>Caring for an FIV-Infected Cat<br></h1>
      <p>• Keep your cat indoors. This will protect him from contact with disease-causing agents to which he may be
        susceptible. By bringing your cat indoors,<br> you’re also protecting the uninfected cats in your community.<br>
        • Watch for changes—even seemingly minor—in your cat’s health and behavior. Immediately report any health
        concerns to your vet.<br>
        • Bring your cat to your vet at least twice per year for a wellness checkup, blood count and urine analysis.<br>
        • Feed your cat nutritionally balanced food—no raw food diets,<br> please, as bacteria and parasites in uncooked
        meat and eggs can be dangerous to immunocompromised pets.<br>
        • Be sure your cat is spayed or neutered.<br></p>

      <h1 id="FelV">Feline Leukemia Virus (FelV)</h1>
      <p>First discovered in the 1960s, feline leukemia virus is a transmittable RNA retrovirus that can severely
        inhibit a cat’s immune system.<br> It is one of the most commonly diagnosed causes of disease and death in
        domestic cats. Because the virus doesn’t always manifest symptoms right away,<br> any new cat entering a
        household—and any sick cat—should be tested for FeLV.<br>
        FeLV weakens an animal’s immune system and predisposes cats to a variety of infections and diseases,<br>
        including anemia, kidney disease and lymphosarcoma, a highly malignant and fatal cancer of the lymph system.<br>
        Young kittens and cats less than one year of age are most susceptible to the virus.<br> Cats living with an
        infected cat, allowed outdoors where they may be bitten by an infected cat,<br> and kittens born to a mother who
        is FeLV positive are most at risk for infection.<br>
        • The FeLV virus is shed in many bodily fluids, including saliva, nasal secretions, urine, feces and blood.<br>
        • FeLV is most commonly transmitted through direct contact, mutual grooming and through sharing litter boxes,
        food and water bowls.<br>
        • It can also be passed in utero or through mother’s milk.<br>
        • Infected outdoor cats fighting with other cats can transmit the disease through bites and scratches.<br>
        Healthy cats over three months of age and vaccinated for FeLV are highly unlikely to contract the virus from
        another cat.<br> </p>
      <h1>Signs of FeLV</h1>
      <h2>Cats can be infected and show no signs. Others may exhibit:</h2>
      <p>• Loss of appetite and weight loss<br>
        • Pale or inflamed gums<br>
        • Poor coat condition<br>
        • Abcesses<br>
        • Fever<br>
        • Upper respiratory infections<br>
        • Diarrhea and vomiting<br>
        • Seizures<br>
        • Changes in behavior<br>
        • Vision or other eye problems<br>
        • Enlarged lymph nodes<br>
        • Reproductive problems (in females)<br>
        • Jaundice<br>
        • Chronic skin disease<br>
        • Respiratory distress<br>
        • Lethargy<br></p>
      <h1>Preventing FelV</h1>
      <p>• There is a vaccine available for cats who are at risk of contracting FeLV. Like all vaccines,<br> there are
        risks involved in vaccination, and the vaccine is not a 100% guarantee against infection.<br> Your veterinarian
        can best evaluate whether this vaccine is right for your cat.<br>
        • As with any infectious disease, the best prevention is eliminating sources of exposure.<br> Routine FeLV
        testing and keeping your cat indoors and away from cats whose FeLV status is not known <br>remain the best way
        to prevent your cat from becoming infected.<br></p>
      <h1>Diagnosing FelV</h1>
      <h2>There are several types of tests available to diagnose FeLV.</h2>
      <p>• Most veterinarians and shelter professionals use the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test,<br>
        which detects antigen to the FELV virus in the bloodstream.<br>
        • Other tests like the IFA (indirect fluorescent antibody) test or PCR (polymerase chain reaction)<br> test are
        recommended to confirm positive ELISA test results.<br></p>
      <h1>for a Cat with FelV</h1>
      <p>• Feed your cat a nutritionally balanced diet, one free of raw meat, eggs and unpasteurized dairy products,
        <br>which can harbor bacteria and parasites and lead to infection.<br>
        • Provide a quiet place for your cat to rest indoors and away from other cats who could promote disease.<br>
        • Bring your cat to the vet every six months—at the very least—for a wellness checkup and blood tests.<br>
        • During the early stages of infection, a cat may not show any clinical signs, but he can still pass the<br>
        virus to other cats. It’s not advisable to introduce a new uninfected cat into the household,<br> even one who
        has been properly vaccinated against FeLV.<br> Those living in close quarters with infected cats are most at
        risk for infection,<br> and should be tested for the virus and, if negative, be housed separately.<br>
        • FeLV is contagious to other cats, but not to humans or other species.<br> Other cats in the house can acquire
        the virus from an infected cat. <br>Though the virus doesn’t live long outside of the body, and is easily
        inactivated with common disinfectants,<br> it can be passed through mutual grooming, shared food and water as
        well as common litter boxes.<br>
        • Sadly there is no cure for FeLV, and it is estimated that less than 20% of clinically <br>infected cats
        survive more than three years of active infection. In the case of those cats who develop cancer,<br>
        chemotherapy can help prolong life, but treatment often focuses on providing the best quality of life.<br>
